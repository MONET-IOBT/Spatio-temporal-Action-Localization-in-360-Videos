# Real-time Action Localization in 360 Videos

This is our implementation of a real-time action localization system for 360 videos. It detects sequences of bounding boxes in a video called action tubes.

train-sph-ucf24.py is for training the model on either UCF24 or JHMDB21.

test-sph-ucf24.py is for testing the model and compute the frame-level mAP.

test-sph-ucf24.py is for testing the model and compute the tube-level mAP.
